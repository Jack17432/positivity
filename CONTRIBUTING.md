# Contributing to Positivity

"Many hands make light work." - John Heywood

In the spirit of collective endeavor and intellectual collaboration, we invite contributions to `positivity`. This document aims to outline the process and guidelines for contributing to this crate, encouraging a rich tapestry of ideas and robust discourse that reflect our shared commitment to excellence and the betterment of the community.

## Philosophical Underpinnings of Contribution

"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another." - Proverbs 27:17

At `positivity`, we believe that the synthesis of diverse perspectives and expertise not only enriches our project but also refines the individual capabilities of our contributors. Each contribution, whether a simple correction of a typo or a substantial enhancement of functionality, is a stone in the edifice of our communal endeavor.

## Prerequisites for Contribution

Before you contribute, ensure familiarity with Rust programming and a thorough understanding of the `positivity` crate's functionality. Familiarity with foundational computer science concepts and partial order theories, as applied in the crate, will enhance the depth and utility of your contributions.

## How to Contribute

### Steps to Contributing

1. **Fork the Repository**
    - Initiate your journey by forking the repository, thus creating a personal copy where you can experiment and implement your changes.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**
    - "The secret of getting ahead is getting started." - Mark Twain
    - Clone your fork to your local machine to begin the hands-on phase of your contribution.

3. **Create a Branch**
    - Branches are like the thoughts of the mind; they must be focused and directed.
    - Create a branch in your cloned repository. This branch is where you will make all your changes. Ideally, name it in a way that reflects the nature of your contribution.

4. **Make Necessary Modifications**
    - Engage deeply with the code. As Aristotle posited, "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."
    - Implement your changes thoughtfully, adhering to the coding standards and architectural design of `positivity`.

5. **Commit Your Changes**
    - "Quality is not an act, it is a habit." - Aristotle
    - Commit your changes with clear, concise messages that describe the intent and scope of each commit. This practice aids in the clarity and tracking of project evolution.

6. **Push Changes to GitHub**
    - After committing your changes locally, push them to your fork on GitHub.

7. **Submit a Pull Request**
    - The final step is to submit a pull request to the `positivity` repository. This pull request should detail the nature of your changes and any other relevant information that will aid the maintainers in the review process.

### Review Process

- Contributions will be reviewed for technical merit and compatibility with the project goals.
- As Seneca the Younger wrote, "It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult."
- Engage with the feedback from the reviewers. This dialogue is crucial as it ensures the alignment of the contribution with the projectâ€™s standards and goals.

## Code of Conduct

- Respect and professionalism should govern your interactions within the project community.
- "Respect for ourselves guides our morals; respect for others guides our manners." - Laurence Sterne

## Conclusion

"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller

Your contributions are not merely additions of code; they are vital interactions that shape the future of `positivity`. Each contribution reflects a commitment to not only the project but also to the broader open-source community engaged in this intellectual journey.

We eagerly anticipate your inventive and thoughtful additions to our collective endeavor. May our collaborative efforts lead to both the enhancement of `positivity` and the enrichment of all who sail in her.
