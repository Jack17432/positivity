# Positivity: An Exposition on Non-Negativity

Welcome to `positivity`, a Rust crate meticulously crafted to ascertain the non-negativity of values transcending a spectrum of types within the realm of computable contexts. This crate is a beacon of utility for developers requiring a robust, generic interface to assess whether values uphold a condition of being greater than or equal to their intrinsic default state.

## Comprehensive Feature Synopsis

- **Generic Implementation Par Excellence**: `positivity` operates seamlessly across any conceivable type that adheres to the traits `PartialOrd` and `Default`. This design paradigm ensures maximal applicability and utility across disparate data types, fostering an environment of computational generality and flexibility.
- **Optimized for Minimal Computational Overhead**: Engineered for efficiency, this crate imposes minimal performance penalties, making it ideally suited for high-performance computing scenarios where computational resources are at a premium.
- **Extensively Documented for Maximum Edification**: Each function within this crate is accompanied by exhaustive documentation that not only elucidates its operational mechanics but also explores the philosophical underpinnings of its functionality.

## Initiation into Positivity

### Installation Procedure

To integrate `positivity` into your Rust-based software ecosystem, append the following declaration to your project's Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
positivity = "0.1.0"
```

### Primer on Usage

Embark on your journey with `positivity` through this elementary example:

```rust
use positivity::is_positive;

fn main() {
    let num = 42;
    let result = is_positive(num);
    println!("Is the number positive? {}", result); // Elegantly outputs: Is the number positive? true
}
```

## In-Depth Documentation and Typographical Conventions

The central function of `positivity`, `is_positive`, offers a gateway into the evaluation of non-negativity, predicated on the principles of partial order theory relative to a type's default state.

### Signature of Functionality

```rust
pub fn is_positive<T: PartialOrd + Default>(value: T) -> bool
```

This signature delineates a function that imparts a boolean verdict, affirming true if the value surpasses or meets its default condition, false otherwise.

## Illustrative Examples

Explore the robustness of `positivity` with these detailed examples:

```rust
assert_eq!(is_positive(0), true); // Affirms that zero is non-negative, adhering to the conventions of integer types.
assert_eq!(is_positive(-1), false); // Rightly identifies negative one as a negative value.
assert_eq!(is_positive(0.0), true); // Floating-point zero is confirmed as non-negative.
```
